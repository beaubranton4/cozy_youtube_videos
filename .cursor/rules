# Cursor Rules for cozy_youtube_videos

# General behavior rules
- Always prioritize code quality and maintainability over quick solutions
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Include comprehensive docstrings for all functions and classes
- Add appropriate error handling for file operations and external processes
- Ensure backward compatibility when modifying existing functions

# Project-specific rules
- Keep the modular structure of the project intact
- Maintain separation between raw and production files
- Respect the channel concept structure defined in channel_concepts.json
- Don't modify the core workflow steps without explicit permission
- Ensure all scripts have proper command-line interfaces with help text

# File organization rules
- New utility functions should go in scripts/utils/
- New generation scripts should go in scripts/generation/
- New video processing scripts should go in scripts/video/
- Channel-specific code should never be hardcoded; always use the channel_concepts.json

# Code generation rules
- Always make scripts executable with proper shebang lines
- Include imports at the top of the file
- Group related functions together
- Use consistent naming conventions:
  - snake_case for functions and variables
  - CamelCase for classes
  - UPPER_CASE for constants
- Add appropriate type hints where possible

# Testing and validation
- Suggest manual testing steps when adding new functionality
- Validate user inputs before processing
- Check for required dependencies before executing external commands
- Provide clear error messages when operations fail

# Documentation rules
- Update README.md when adding new features
- Keep PROJECT_GUIDE.md in sync with code changes
- Document command-line arguments for all scripts
- Include examples of how to use new functionality

# Performance considerations
- Be mindful of memory usage when processing large media files
- Use efficient algorithms for file operations
- Consider adding progress indicators for long-running operations
- Implement proper cleanup of temporary files
